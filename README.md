# Open boxes in python

 For this problem, we can use lists and dictionaries in python
 These are mutable data structures, which mean they can be modified
 without creating a whole new copy of the entire data
 We can say that our data is a list of boxes, and each box has a
 status of either opened or closed.  We will programmatically apply
 the following steps to set the final status of every box

---

## Steps

 **Step 1:** For each box in series, open every box (or simply, start
 			 with every box open in our program)
 
 **Step 2:** Starting with the 2nd box, open every 2nd box

 **Step 3:** Starting with the 3rd box, change every 3rd box's status to 
 			 be the opposite of what it currently is

 **Step 4:** Starting with the 4th box, change each 4th box's status to 
 			 be the opposite of what it currently is

 **Step 5:** Finaly, starting with the 5th box, change every 5th box's 
			 status to be the opposite of what it currently is
